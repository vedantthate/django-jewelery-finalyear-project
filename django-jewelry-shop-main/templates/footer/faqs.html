            Unfortunately, customized jewelry is non-returnable unless the item is defective or damaged. Since each piece is made according to your specific order, it is unique to you. However, if you notice any defects, such as an engraving error, broken piece, or any other issue upon receiving your order, please reach out to us immediately with photos of the item and its issue. We will work with you to resolve the matter by either issuing a refund, sending a replacement, or offering a store credit, depending on the situation. Please ensure that you inspect your customized items upon arrival to avoid any delays in resolving issues.

            Delivery times vary depending on your location, the shipping method selected, and the availability of the items ordered. For domestic orders, standard delivery typically takes between 3-7 business days, depending on the delivery address and shipping carrier. If you need your items sooner, we also offer expedited shipping options at checkout, which can deliver your order within 1-2 business days for an additional fee. International shipping can take longer, typically between 7-14 business days, depending on the destination country and customs processing times. We will provide you with a tracking number once your order ships so you can track your delivery in real-time.
